/* 1. Create the HTML you need
    - Three buttons for the player to choose from
    - Player button to trigger the computer's turn
    - A message we can use to show the result. Put some temporary content ([a random message]()http://www.cupcakeipsum.com) there to test the styling
2. Add some *basic* styling for those
3. Figure out a way to know when the "play" button was clicked (tip: you'll need `events` in JavaScript for that, and you'll need to `handle` those)
4. Next up, we want to determine the computer's choice
    - How many choices does the computer have? What can be a suitable datatype to store multiple things?
    - How can you select a random element from these choices? The math options in JavaScript might help you here
5. Determine the payers result: draw / win / lose. It's okay if this involves a lot of conditional statements (if)
6. Depending on the result, change the `inner html` (hint hint) of the message to congratulate or comfort the player
